            Marble is a web and mobile SaaS project made for landlords wanting a more simplified rental management
            experience. Focused on automating many of the processes many older project management companies continue to
            do manually, a lot of the property life-cycle has been done programatically to reduce the overhead needed to
            find a tenant or keep a property maintained.

            As a software engineer part of the engineering team, my focus was on improving user experience and reducing
            manual workload from operations, designed and implemented multiple features to alleviate any friction and
            obstacles between the customer and product.
